<!--TODO: Clipboard in entry instead -->
<!-- problems putting clipboard inside both entry and shared specialcharacters.js. Could not import clipboard
in shared because node complains it ha no document (so true), and importing only in entry file results in not defined
when trying to use clipboard.
So temp solution is to create a small specialized page class which include clipboard.-->
